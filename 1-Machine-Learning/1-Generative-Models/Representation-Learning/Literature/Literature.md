# Representation Learning



Designing the appropriate objectives for learning a good representation is an open question [^1]. The work in [^2] is among the first to use an encoder-decoder structure for representation learning, which, however, is not explicitly disentangled. DC-IGN [^3] use a variational autoencoder-based method to disentangled representation learning. However, DC-IGN achieves disentanglement by providing batch training samples with one attribute being fixed, which may not be applicable to unstructured in-the-wild data. 



we hope to explicitly disentangle the identity representation by using the pose code
