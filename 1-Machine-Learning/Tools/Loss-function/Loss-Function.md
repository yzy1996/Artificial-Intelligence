## Object Detection





### edge and boundary detection

- Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED)







### Salient Object Detection

The goal is to identify the most visually distinctive objects or regions in an image and then segment them out from the background. Different from semantic segmentation, it pays more attention to very few objectives that are interesting and attractive.



Application includes image and video compression, content-aware image editing, object recognition etc.
