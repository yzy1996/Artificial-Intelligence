# Transfer-Learning

Recommendation: https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning





## Definition

> (from Sinno Jialin Pan and Qiang Yang) Given a source domain  $D_S = \{X_S, f_S(X)\}$ and learning task $T_S$, a target domain $D_T = \{X_T, f_T(X)\}$ and learning task $T_T$, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function $f_T(\cdot)$ in $D_T$ using the knowledge in $D_S$ and $T_S$, where $D_{S} \neq D_{T}$, or $T_{S} \neq T_{T}$.
