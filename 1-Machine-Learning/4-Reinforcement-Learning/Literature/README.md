[`Prediction-Guided Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Robot Control`]

[`PMLR`] [`2020`]



**problem**: multi-objective optimization for complex continuous robot control

**difficulty**: 



**main work**: they propose an efficient evolutionary learning algorithm to find the Pareto set approximation for continuous robot control problems.



**main methods**: 

Prediction-Guided MORL



first find a discrete set of Pareto policies, then extract to a continuous Pareto set by intra-family interpolation.



**existing methods**: 

- compute a meta policy (not necessarily optimal but can be relatively quickly adapted to different trade-offs)



discover the individual policies on the Pareto front; construct a continuous set of Pareto-optimal solutions by **Pareto analysis** and **interpolation**.
