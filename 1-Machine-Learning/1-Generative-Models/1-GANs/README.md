If you want to know more about more details of the derivation or the difficult of GAN’s training, you can see the part of [Traditional GAN](#Traditional-GAN)



**Why Are GANs So Popular?**

GANs are popular partly because they tackle the important unsolved challenge of unsupervised learning.

If intelligence was a cake, unsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake. We know how to make the icing and the cherry, but we don’t know how to make the cake. – Yann LeCun, 2016.



**Why is there an “s” after GANs?**

> It means GAN and its variants



**Commonly used datasets**

> Mnist, CelebA, LSUN, and ImageNet



**Facing problem**

> - mode collapse: diversity the generator can only learn some limited patterns from the large-scale target datasets, or assigns all of its probability mass to a small region in the space.
> - vanishing gradient:

### objective functions of GANs



**vanilla GAN**
$$
\min _{G} \max _{D} V(D, G)=\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim p_{\mathrm{data}}(\boldsymbol{x})}[\log D(\boldsymbol{x})]+\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim p_{\boldsymbol{z}}(\boldsymbol{z})}[\log (1-D(G(\boldsymbol{z})))]
$$

$$
\min J^G = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z} \sim p_{\boldsymbol{z}}(\boldsymbol{z})}[\log (1-D(G(\boldsymbol{z})))]
$$

where $J^G$ is the cost of for generator, $\log D(x)$ is the cross-entropy between $[D(x) \quad 1-D(x)]^T$ and $[1 \quad 0]^T$. Likewise,  $\log (1-D(G(z)))$ is the cross-entropy between $[1-D(G(z)) \quad D(G(z))]^T$ and $[1 \quad 0]^T$. It’s because that the cross-entropy 

For a fixed generator $G$, the optimal discriminator $D$ is:
$$
D^*(x)=\frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x)+p_{g}(x)},
$$
For this optimal $D^*$, the optimal $G$ satisfies:
$$
p_g(x) =p_{data}(x).
$$

> Problem: 
>
> The cross-entropy of $G$ can be expressed as follow:
> $$
> H^G = 1 * \log(1-D(G(z))) + 0*log(D(G(z))) = \log(1-D(G(z)))
> $$
> In early training progress, D can easily distinguish fake samples from real samples ($D(G(z)) \rightarrow 0$). This results in G not having sufficient gradient to improve, which is called **training instability**. Rather than training G in the way of Equation (2), another way of Equation (6) could provides larger gradients in early training.

A GAN consists of a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$, both are conducted by a neural network. $G$ takes a latent variable $z \sim p(z)$ sampled from a prior distribution and maps it to the observation space $\mathcal{X}$. $D$ takes an observation $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and produces a decision output over possible observation sources (either from $G$ or from the empirical data distribution). 



The generator and the discriminator in the standard GAN training procedure are trained by minimizing the following objectives:
$$
\begin{align}
&L_{D}=-\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text {data }}}[\log D(x)]-\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[1-\log D(G(z))], \\
&L_{G}=-\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[\log D(G(z))].
\end{align}
$$
This formulation is originally proposed by Goodfellow et al. (2014) as non-saturating (NS) GAN. A significant amount of research has been done on modifying this formulation in order to improve the training process. A notable example is the **hinge-loss** version of the adversarial loss:
$$
\begin{align}
&L_{D}=-\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text {data }}}[\min (0,-1+D(x))]-\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[\min (0,-1-D(G(z)))], \\
&L_{G}=-\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[D(G(z))].
\end{align}
$$
Another commonly adopted GAN formulation is the **Wassertein** GAN (WGAN), where the authors propose clipping the weights to enforce the continuous of Wassertein distance. The loss function of WGAN is:
$$
\begin{align}
&L_{D}=-\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text {data }}}[D(x)]+\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[D(G(z))], \\
&L_{G}=-\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[D(G(z))].
\end{align}
$$
