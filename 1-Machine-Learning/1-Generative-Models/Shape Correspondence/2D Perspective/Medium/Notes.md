> **Summary**

They explore the task of Canonical Surface Mapping (CSM) which means ''given an image, learn to map pixels on the object to their corresponding locations on an abstract 3D model of the category''. This brings possibility of inferring dense correspondence across images of a category.

They combine **pixel-to-3D** and **3D-to-pixel** to form a **cycle** and then use a geometric cycle consistency loss to achieve unsupervised training.

> **Summary**

**dubbed-"KeypointNet"**

learn category- specific 3D keypoints by solving an auxiliary task of rigid registration between multiple renders of the same shape and by considering the category instances to be pre-aligned.

from an end-to-end geometric reasoning framework, jointly optimize the keypoints.

also show these 3D keypoints can infer their depths without access to object geometry.

using aligned 3D and multiple 2D images with known pose.
