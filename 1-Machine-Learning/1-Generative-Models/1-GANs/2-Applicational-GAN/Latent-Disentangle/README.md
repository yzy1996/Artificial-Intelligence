Representation learning: A review and new perspectives

Challenging common assumptions in the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations.



Disentanglement can be defined as the ability to control a single factor, or feature, without affecting other ones [Locatello et al. 2018] A properly disentangled representation can benefit semantic data mixing [Johnson et al. 2016; Xiao et al. 2019], transfer learning for downstream tasks [Bengio et al. 2013; Tschannen et al. 2018], or even interpretability [Mathieu et al. 2018].



**challenge: reducing supervision**



supervised solutions are most effective [Aberman et al. 2019]

but often impose infeasible data collection requirement
